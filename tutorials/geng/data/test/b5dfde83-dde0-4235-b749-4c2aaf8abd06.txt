Jon Perpich lost his class ring while boating on Lake Vermilion in 1977  For almost 40 years, he had desperately searched for the 14-carat gold ring Now 38 years on, he has been reunited with the jewellery after it was found Teenager Brody Skala discovered the ring while fishing in the last last month       Jon Perpich who has been reunited with his class ring, which he lost in a lake almost 40 years ago   A former student who lost his class ring in a Minnesota lake has been reunited with it almost 40 years after it went missing.  
Jon Perpich had been boating with his then wife-to-be Marilyn on Lake Vermilion in 1977, when the 1974 Virginia High School ring flew off his finger.  
He desperately searched for the 14-carat gold ring, which had cost $129 and was engraved with his initials.  
But 38 years after he last saw the ring, it has now turned up after it was discovered in the water by teenager, who had been picking clams.  
And after tracking Mr Perpich down, he has now been reunited with his piece of jewellery, which is in near-perfect condition.  
Mr Perpich said: 'We were playing football offshore, and the football we were using was a can of beer.   'I was tossing the can when the ring flew off.
The can went about five feet but the ring flew about 50.'  
Mr Perpich then searched for hours and would even return to the lake each summer in a bid to find it.  
However, last month, University of Minnesota Duluth student Brody Skala discovered the ring while fishing.   
He said: 'I was picking clams.
I stuck my hand in the sand and the ring slid right on to my finger.   'It was in pretty good shape with a blue stone, the words 'Roosevelt Virginia HS, the initials JP and the year 1974 on it. '     
Mr Perpich had desperately searched for the 14-carat gold ring, which had cost $129 and was engraved with his initials   The teenager then went to the local library to look at the school's 1974 yearbook and suspected the ring could belong to Mr Perpich.  
He then got in touch with him after learning his grandparents had been customers of Mr Perpich's TV and appliance store in Mountain Iron.  
But despite the ring being slightly tarnished, Mr Perpich has no plans to clean it up, saying it adds to the character of the jewellery.
